  description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mods adds small tweaks to the KTANE to
    make the game just a bit better.\r\n\r\n[h1]Tweaks[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Picks
    the smallest case that fits the number of modules on the bomb.\r\n[*] Adds a new
    modes to solve bombs: Time Mode and Zen Mode. See the \u201CModes\u201D section
    below.\r\n[*] Adds two separate HUDs, one showing the bomb status and the other
    showing edgework.\r\n[*] Fixes the URL that the module Foreign Exchange Rates
    uses since the old one no longer works.\r\n[*] Instantly skips the gameplay loading
    screen as soon as possible.\r\n[*] Sets the fade time to be the same between scenes.\r\n[*]
    Centers the status lights on modules.\r\n[*] Turn the Mods Only key on by default.\r\n[*]
    Removes the maximum time limit in the freeplay briefcase.\r\n[*] Makes the minimum
    number of modules in the freeplay briefcase to 1.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Future
    Tweaks[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Add logging to modules that don't already have it.
    (Probing, Orientation Cube, etc)\r\n[*] Save numbered copies of the logfile.\r\n[*]
    Fix timer for longer bombs.\r\n[*] ??? (I'd love to hear your ideas!)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Settings[/h1]\r\nThe
    settings can be found in a file called \"TweakSettings\" in your \"Modsettings\"
    folder.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]FadeTime[/b] (Default: 1) - The number seconds should
    it take to fade in and out of scenes. If the is negative then the game default's
    will not be changed.\r\n[*] [b]InstantSkip[/b] (Default: true) - If the gameplay
    loading screen be skipped as soon as possible.\r\n[*] [b]BetterCasePicker[/b]
    (Default: true) - If the smallest case that fits should be picked instead of a
    random one.\r\n[*] [b]EnableModsOnlyKey[/b] (Default: false) - Turns the Mods
    Only key to be on by default.\r\n[*] [b]FixFER[/b] (Default: false) - Changes
    the URL that is queried by Foreign Exchange Rates since the old one is no longer
    operational. See the module\u2019s [url=https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Foreign%20Exchange%20Rates.html]manual[/url]
    for the new URL.\r\n[*] [b]BombHUD[/b] (Default: false) - Adds a HUD in the top
    right corner showing information about the currently selected bomb.\r\n[*] [b]ShowEdgework[/b]
    (Default: false) - Adds a HUD to the top of the screen showing the edgework for
    the currently selected bomb.\r\n[*] [b]Mode[/b] (Default: \u201CNormal\u201D)
    - Sets the mode for the next bomb. Acceptable values are \u201CNormal\u201D, \u201CTime\u201D
    and \u201CZen\u201D. See the \"Modes\" section below.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b]
    If you enable BombHUD, ShowEdgework or use a Mode other than Normal you won't
    be able to set records on leaderboards or change your stats.\r\n\r\n[h1]Modes[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]
    [b]Time Mode[/b] is a different way to solve bombs that gives you time as you
    solve modules. When you solve a module it's point value is multiplied by the multiplier
    and then that number of seconds is added to your timer. As you solve modules your
    multiplier goes up with each solve, but if you get a strike your multiplier is
    reduced and you lose a percentage of your time.\r\n[*] [b]Zen Mode[/b] is another
    way to solves bombs in which strikes never explode the bomb and the timer counts
    up instead. You can configure it so that if you get a strike the timer speeds
    up and/or it gives a time penalty. You can use this mode to practice or to race
    against someone else to see who can solve a bomb faster.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Mode
    Settings[/h1]\r\nThe settings for all the modes are found in a file called \"ModeSettings\"
    in your \"Modsettings\" folder.\r\nAn [url=https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Mode%20Settings%20Editor.html]editor[/url]
    has been created so you can modify this file easily. It contains the following
    settings:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeStartingTime[/b] (Default: 5) - The number
    of minutes on the timer when you start a bomb.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeStartingMultiplier[/b]
    (Default: 9) - The initial multiplier.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMaxMultiplier[/b] (Default:
    10) - The highest the multiplier can go.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinMultiplier[/b] (Default:
    1) - The lowest the multiplier can go.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeSolveBonus[/b] (Default:
    0.1) - The amount added to the multiplier when you solve a module.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMultiplierStrikePenalty[/b]
    (Default: 1.5) - The amount subtracted from the multiplier when you get a strike.\r\n[*]
    [b]TimeModeTimerStrikePenalty[/b] (Default: 0.25) - Percent of the time subtracted
    when you get a strike.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinimumTimeLost[/b] (Default: 15) - Lowest
    amount of time that you can lose when you get a strike.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinimumTimeGained[/b]
    (Default: 20) - Lowest amount of time you can gain when you solve a module.\r\n[*]
    [b]ZenModeTimePenalty[/b] (Default: 0) - The base amount of minutes to be penalized
    for getting a strike.\r\n[*] [b]ZenModeTimePenaltyIncrease[/b] (Default: 0) -
    The number of minutes to add to the penalty each time you get a strike after the
    first.\r\n[*] [b]ZenModeTimerSpeedUp[/b] (Default: 0.25) - The rate the timer
    speeds up when you get a strike. For example, if this value is 0.25 then the timer
    speeds up to 1.25x for the first strike, 1.5x for the second, etc.\r\n[*] [b]ZenModeTimerMaxSpeed[/b]
    (Default: 2) - The maximum rate the timer can be set to. For example, 2 is twice
    as fast as the normal timer.\r\n[*] [b]ComponentValues[/b] - The point value for
    each module specified by its module ID.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Deprecated Mods[/h1]\r\nThe
    following mods have been deprecated as their function has been implemented in
    this mod. It is recommended that you unsubscribe from them if you subscribe to
