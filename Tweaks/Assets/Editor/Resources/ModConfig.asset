  description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThis mods adds small tweaks to the KTANE to make
    the game just a bit better.\r\n\r\n[h1]Tweaks[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Picks the
    smallest case that fits the number of modules on the bomb.\r\n[*] Adds a new way
    to solve the bomb with called Time Mode. See the \"Time Mode\" section below.\r\n[*]
    Adds two separate HUDs, one showing the bomb status and the other showing edgework.\r\n[*]
    Fixes the URL that the module Foreign Exchange Rates uses since the old one no
    longer works.\r\n[*] Instantly skips the gameplay loading screen as soon as possible.\r\n[*]
    Sets the fade time to be the same between scenes.\r\n[*] Centers the status lights
    on modules.\r\n[*] Removes the maximum time limit in the freeplay briefcase.\r\n[*]
    Makes the minimum number of modules in the freeplay briefcase to 1.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Future
    Tweaks[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Add logging to modules that don't already have it.
    (Probing, Orientation Cube, etc)\r\n[*] Save numbered copies of the logfile.\r\n[*]
    Fix timer for longer bombs.\r\n[*] ??? (I'd love to hear your ideas!)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Settings[/h1]\r\nThe
    settings can be found in a file called \"TweakSettings\" in your \"Modsettings\"
    folder.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]FadeTime[/b] (Default: 1) - The number seconds should
    it take to fade in and out of scenes. If the is negative then the game default's
    will not be changed.\r\n[*] [b]InstantSkip[/b] (Default: true) - If the gameplay
    loading screen be skipped as soon as possible.\r\n[*] [b]BetterCasePicker[/b]
    (Default: true) - If the smallest case that fits should be picked instead of a
    random one.\r\n[*] [b]FixFER[/b] (Default: false) - Changes the URL that is queried
    by Foreign Exchange Rates since the old one is no longer operational. See the
    module\u2019s [url=https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Foreign%20Exchange%20Rates.html]manual[/url]
    for the new URL.\r\n[*] [b]BombHUD[/b] (Default: false) - Adds a HUD in the top
    right corner showing information about the currently selected bomb.\r\n[*] [b]ShowEdgework[/b]
    (Default: false) - Adds a HUD to the top of the screen showing the edgework for
    the currently selected bomb.\r\n[*] [b]TimeMode[/b] (Default: false) - Enables
    Time Mode. See the \"Time Mode\" section below.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b]
    If you enable BombHUD, ShowEdgework or TimeMode you won't be able to set records
    on leaderboards or change your stats.\r\n\r\n[h1]Time Mode[/h1]\r\nTime Mode is
    a different way to solve bombs that gives you time as you solve modules. When
    you solve a module it's point value is multiplied by the multiplier and then that
    number of seconds is added to your timer. As you solve modules your multiplier
    goes up with each solve, but if you get a strike your multiplier is reduced and
    you lose a percentage of your time.\r\n\r\nThe settings for Time Mode are found
    in a file called \"ModeSettings\" in your \"Modsettings\" folder.\r\nAn [url=https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Mode%20Settings%20Editor.html]editor[/url]
    has been created so you can modify this file easily. It contains the following
    settings:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeStartingTime[/b] (Default: 5) - The number
    of minutes on the timer when you start a bomb.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeStartingMultiplier[/b]
    (Default: 9) - The initial multiplier.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMaxMultiplier[/b] (Default:
    10) - The highest the multiplier can go.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinMultiplier[/b] (Default:
    1) - The lowest the multiplier can go.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeSolveBonus[/b] (Default:
    0.1) - The amount added to the multiplier when you solve a module.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMultiplierStrikePenalty[/b]
    (Default: 1.5) - The amount subtracted from the multiplier when you get a strike.\r\n[*]
    [b]TimeModeTimerStrikePenalty[/b] (Default: 0.25) - Percent of the time subtracted
    when you get a strike.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinimumTimeLost[/b] (Default: 15) - Lowest
    amount of time that you can lose when you get a strike.\r\n[*] [b]TimeModeMinimumTimeGained[/b]
    (Default: 20) - Lowest amount of time you can gain when you solve a module.\r\n[*]
    [b]ComponentValues[/b] - The point value for each module specified by its module
    ID.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Deprecated Mods[/h1]\r\nThe following mods have been
    deprecated as their function has been implemented in this mod. It is recommended
    that you unsubscribe from them if you subscribe to this one.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]
